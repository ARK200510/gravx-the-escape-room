## 🚀 Overview

GravX is a 2D gravity-based puzzle platformer built using **JavaFX**.  
The player can flip gravity to move between floor and ceiling, collect coins, avoid fire traps, and unlock the exit gate.

## 💡 Hackathon Experience

This project was built during a hackathon in just **3.5 hours**.

I had no prior experience in game development.  
The only language I was comfortable with was **Java**, so I chose JavaFX and decided to build a gravity-based puzzle game from scratch.

Handling gravity logic, collision detection, UI transitions, and gameplay mechanics under time pressure made this a challenging yet extremely rewarding experience.

This project represents my first step into game development.
